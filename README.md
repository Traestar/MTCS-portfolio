# MTCS-portfolio
This is my sandbox/portfolio that I use for all of the projects that I do.

Currently now it is in HTML/CSS/Javascript/Bootstrap. I will be working to minimize the code, automate the process of a new project,
and have an overall balanced site.

Looking to work with some of the new languages with this project.
