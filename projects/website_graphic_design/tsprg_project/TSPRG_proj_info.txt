Project Title: 

Terminal Surveillance Performance and Registration Group

Project Description:

Created a server portal for the Terminal Surveillance Performance and Registration Group (TSPRG) project. 
A portal was needed in order to maintain project documents and data.

Inspiration and Design:

The design and structure of the portal was discussed with a Project Lead. The objective was to create another 
directory in a much bigger intranet portal and to use the design of the other pages to create the TSPRG portal.

Project Progress:

The original TSPRG portal pages were created using PHP, HTML, and CSS. The portal worked but it was honestly 
a mess. The main issue with the page was that it was not organized and lacked a easy to read and understand design. 
So he used a CMS system called CMS Made Simple in order to redesign the portal. It provided a better look, 
organization, and functionality of the overall site.

Final Design:


The final look of the site was without question an update to the old portal, with a briefing on the main page, 
a better working log-in and registration page, clear navigation and better radar site page.
