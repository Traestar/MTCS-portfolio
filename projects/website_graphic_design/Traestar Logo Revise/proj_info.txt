#category: Graphic/Logo Design

#short desc: A Revision of the original Traestar Logo from 2006

#long desc: This WORKS!! This is the revision of the original Traestar Logo from 2006 of which I've used for
many years. Feel it is time to revise and restructure the logo, keeping the original idea but creating a more detailed, professional,
and clean look to the logo. This will be used for branding for my personal use and so forth.

#skills: GIMP, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Adobe Photoshop
